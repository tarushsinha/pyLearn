## Python is a high - level programming language
## More on low - mid - high level languages here: https://stackoverflow.com/q/3468068/

## tl;dr: Low Level Language: Little to no abstraction from Computer's Instruction Set Architecture.
## Because of the small amount of abstraction between the language & machine language, described as
## being 'close to the hardware'
## tl;dr High Level Lanugage: Isolates the execution semantics of a computer architecture from the
## specification of the program, making the development process simpler & more understandable

## Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter - program that runs scripts written in an
## interpreted language. Removes the requirement for compile before executing

## First language usage - as is tradition:
helloWorld = "Hello World"
print(f'Print statment is being used to output this text: {helloWorld}')
